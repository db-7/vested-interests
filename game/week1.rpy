    "In highschool, Jessica and I were never really in the same circles. "
    "When we occasionally crossed paths we got along just fine. "
    "Jessica was always such an upbeat girl, I thought she was sweet."

    "When I noticed that Jessica was into one of my friends I tried to help set them up."
    "But… Jessica had taken it as an insult. She said I was just ‘rubbing it in her face’."
    "I didn’t know that my friend had a crush on me at the time… but Jessica never gave me the chance to explain."
    
    "Instead of the kind girl I knew, Jessica became cold and envious."
    "Eventually, rumors about me started to spread."
    "‘I heard that Nyx has fun leading guys on. She likes seeing them wrapped around her little finger.’"
    "‘Did you hear that Nyx goes after men in relationships? Jessica said that Nyx stole her boyfriend.’"
    "I didn’t mind the whispers and it didn’t take long for them to dissipate."
    "I was only upset that Jessica would stoop so low to get at me."
    "We really could have been good friends…"
    
    "After highschool, I never heard from Jessica again."
    "So a couple years later when I was transferring colleges and looking for a place stay-"
    "It was really surprising to get an offer from Jessica."
    "She mentioned sharing a three bed apartment with four other people and I could stay in her room for cheap."
    "Jessica even insisted that we catch up a bit before I officially moved in."
    "I figured it was a good deal and worked out the details with her before I started packing the next day."
    
    "I’ll be meeting her at a cafe tomorrow."
    "I think it'll be nice to see her after all this time."
